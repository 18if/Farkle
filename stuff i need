# What I need:
  1. score sheet
  2. working dice
  3. little animations to show the dice rolling
  4. the player must be able to pick the dice and drag it to the 'aside' box
  5. functions for: play, move, has_won(maybe), scoring sheet, dice, game board?
  6. HELP
# IDEAS:
  1. each die can be a list of values 1-6
  2. scoring sheet will have all the math in it to save space and make it look nice
